- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Because of the timeout function, the console logs foo and baz before any bar messages. 
Foo is the first function called, then it calls bar with setTimeout, then it calls baz. 
So we see foo baz foo baz 2:bar 1:bar in the console because foo is first called with 2, then 1. 
Bar becomes an asynchronous function or callback that is only executed at the end of the program.
Setting the delay to 0 moves the function from the timer queue to the callback queue right away.
There is no need to wait on poll because there is no I/O.
