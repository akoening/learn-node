- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

Even though someAsyncOperation is called first, its output is logged last in the console.
This is because it contains an I/O operation (reading from a file), which pushes it to the poll phase.
Then since poll doesn't have its own queue, once the file read is complete (performed by worker thread), it gets pushed to the pending callbacks queue.
This queue is cleared/executed once the main feed execution is complete, so we get the Read Error last.
